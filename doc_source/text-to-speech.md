# Add text\-to\-speech to prompts<a name="text-to-speech"></a>

You can enter text\-to\-speech prompts in the following contact flow blocks: 
+ [Get customer input](get-customer-input.md) 
+ [Play prompt](play.md)
+ [Store customer input](store-customer-input.md)

You can enter plain text or Speech Synthesis Markup Language \(SSML\)\. 

SSML\-enhanced input text gives you more control over how Amazon Connect generates speech from the text you provide\. You can customize and control aspects of speech such as pronunciation, volume, and speed\.

Amazon Connect uses Amazon Polly, a service that converts text into lifelike speech using SSML\. For more information about Amazon Polly, see [Using SSML](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/ssml.html) in the Amazon Polly Developer Guide\.
