| Contact Lens for Amazon Connect is in preview release and is subject to change\. | 

Rather than listening to an entire call to find out what's interesting about it, with Contact Lens you can quickly review the transcript and identify what part of the call is of interest\. 

For example, you might see that 25 seconds into the call the customer moved from a negative sentiment to a positive one\. You can download the recording and fast\-forward 25 seconds to listen to only that portion of the call\.

**To review a transcript of a voice conversation**

1. Log in to Amazon Connect with a user account that is assigned the **CallCenterManager** security profile\.

1. In Amazon Connect choose **Metrics and quality**, **Contact search**\.

1. Use the filters on the page to narrow your search for a contact\. For date, you can search up to 14 days at a time\. For more information about searching for contacts, see [Contact search](contact-search.md)\. 

1. Click the contact ID to view the Contact Trace Record \(CTR\) for the contact\.

1. In the **Recording and transcript** section of the CTR, review what was spoken and when, and their sentiment\.

1. If desired, choose the play prompt to listen recording\. Or, download the recording and fast\-forward to only the portion you're interested in\.
